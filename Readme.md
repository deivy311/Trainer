### Clonning the repository:

Clone the repository using the next link: 

    https://github.com/deivy311/Test

**If you donâ€™t have the repository, you can download the zip file, attached to the email named ADASI_test_just_code.zip and unzip it.**

### Compiling the code.

***If your unzipping ADASI_test_just_code.zip, you have to add the video files in the folder "Files/" before to compile the code.***

Go to the folder where you clone the repository and run the next commands:

    - mkdir build
    - cd build
    - cmake ../
    - make

# Running the code
Go to the folder where you compile the code and run the executable files, as follows.
There are a total of 5 executables files, from de point_0 to point_5, each one of them has a different functionality. The parameters from Point 0 to Point 2_3 are the same, the only difference is the functionality of each one. And the parameters from Point 4 to Point 5 are the same.

***In any case you must be placed in the root folder/build/bin in order to run the following commands***

For point_0, point_1 and point_2_3 the parameters are:

***Source type***: Defines if we want to stream the camera or a file, by default is autovideosrc , which refers to the camera, there are only two possible options: 

    videotestsrc or autovideosrc
**Examples:**   
    The input example for both cases are:

*Camera case:*

    ./point_1 -s videotestsrc
*File case:*

    ./point_0 -s autovideosrc

**Host**: Defines the host to stream by default is "127.0.0.1" 

*Localhost case*:

    sudo ./point_0 -h 127.0.0.1
**Port**: Defines the port to stream by default is "5002" 
 
*By default case*:

    sudo ./point_0 -p 5002

**For point_4, point_5 and point_2_3 the parameters are same as before but there a couple more:**

**RTSP port**: Defines the RTSP port to stream by default is "5001" 

*By default case*:

    sudo ./point_4 -p_rtsp 5001

*RTSP video file path*: Defines the RTSP video file path to stream by default is "../Files/video_test_2.mp4", these videos are in the Files folder and in the build/bin folder.

*By default case*:

    sudo ./point_5 -f ../Files/video_test_2.mp4

# Results

The executables point_0 and point_1, can show the results for the literal 1, it is a simple RTP pipeline where can stream a video file or a camera. 

## Case 1.1: RTP with no overlay

Given the next command input: 

    ./point_0 -s autovideosrc -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5002

In order to see the results by yourself you have to open VLC and go to Media -> Open Network Stream and put the next address:
    tcp://127.0.0.1:5002
The video related to this is in the Folder Results, named point_1_no_overlay.webm which means it only streams video without any overlay.

## Case 1.2: RTP with overlay, demo file

Given the next command input: 
    
    ./point_1 -s videotestsrc -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5002

In order to see the results by yourself you have to open VLC and go to Media -> Open Network Stream and put the next address:
    
    tcp://127.0.0.1:5002

The video related to this is in the Folder Results, named point_1_overlay_file.webm which means it only streams video with overlay, in this case a red box.

## Case 1.3: RTP with overlay, camera

Given the next command input: 

    ./point_1 -s autovideosrc -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5002
In order to see the results by yourself you have to open VLC and go to Media -> Open Network Stream and put the next address:
 
    tcp://127.0.0.1:5002
The video related to this is in the Folder Results, named point_1_overlay_camera.webm which means it only streams a camera video with overlay, in this case a red box.

The executable **point_2_3**, can show the results for the literal 2 and 3, it is a RTP pipeline where can stream a video file or a camera and also can stream a video file or a camera with dynamic overlay and output the video in H264.

## Case 2.1: RTP with dynamic overlay in H264 format video output, demo file

Given the next command input: 

    ./point_2_3 -s videotestsrc -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5002             
In order to see the results by yourself you have to open VLC and go to Media -> Open Network Stream and put the next address:
      
    tcp://127.0.0.1:5002
The video related to this is in the Folder Results, named point_2_3_dinamic_overlay_file.webm which means it only streams a video file with dynamic overlay and output the video in H264 format.

## Case 2.2: RTP with dynamic overlay in H264 format video output, camera.

Given the next command input: 

    ./point_2_3 -s autovideosrc -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5002

In order to see the results by yourself you have to open VLC and go to Media -> Open Network Stream and put the next address:

    tcp://127.0.0.1:5002        
The video related to this is in the Folder Results, named ***point_2_3_dinamic_overlay_camera.mp4*** which means it only streams a camera video with dynamic overlay and output the camera video in H264 format.    

The Executable **point_4**, can show the results for the literal 4, it is a RTSP pipeline over RTP where can stream a video file or a camera with dinamica overlay and output the video in H264.*
## Case 4.1: RTSP with dinamic overlay in H264 format video output, demo file

Given the next command input: 
    ./point_4 -s videotestsrc -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5002 -p_rtsp 5001 -f ../Files/video_test_2.mp4

***RTP server***
                
The video related to this is in the Folder Results, named point_4_RTP_dinamic_overlay_file.webm which means it streams a video file with dynamic overlay and output the video in H264 format.

The VLC command to see the results is:

    tcp://127.0.0.1:5002

***RTSP server***
         
The video related to this is in the Folder Results, named ***point_4_RTSP_dinamic_overlay_file.mp4*** which means it streams a video file with dinamic overlay and output the video in H264 format.
            
The VLC command to see the results is:

    rtsp://192.168.1.6:5001/test

In this case, 192.168.1.6 is the Ip from, viewed from a host of the same network.

The Executable **point_5**, can show the results for the literal 5, it is a RTSP pipeline over RTP where can stream a video file or a camera with dynamic overlay and output the video in H264. An as additional feature the video streamed is stored.

## Case 5.1: Storing file.

Given the next command input: 

    ./point_5 -s autovideosrc    

The video related to this is in the Folder Results, named ***point_4_RTP_dinamic_overlay_camera.mp4*** which means it streams a camera video with dinamic overlay and output the video in H264 format.

The VLC command to see the results is:

    tcp://127.0.0.1:5002
    rtsp://127.0.0.1:5001/test

The video related to this is in the Folder Results, named ***point_5_RTSP_RTP_dinamic_overlay_camera.mp4*** which means it streams a camera video with dynamic overlay and output the video in H264 format.
